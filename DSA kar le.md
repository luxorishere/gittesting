# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Questions

Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions are commonly asked in technical interviews and coding competitions. Here are some of the most important topics on which DSA questions are asked:

## Arrays

- Array operations (insertion, deletion, searching, sorting)
- Two-pointer technique
- Sliding window technique

## Linked Lists

- Basic operations (insertion, deletion, traversal)
- Reversal of a linked list
- Merging of two sorted linked lists

## Stacks

- Basic operations (push, pop, peek)
- Balanced parentheses problem
- Infix to postfix conversion

## Queues

- Basic operations (enqueue, dequeue, peek)
- Implementing a queue using arrays or linked lists

## Trees

- Binary Trees
  - Basic operations (insertion, deletion, traversal)
  - Height of a binary tree
  - Level Order Traversal (BFS)
- Binary Search Trees
  - Insertion and deletion
  - Searching
  - Finding the minimum and maximum elements
